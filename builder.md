# Builder Guidelines
**Version 0.9.1**

A base16 _builder_ is an application that can build _syntax highlighting definition files_ for text editors and tools, using base16 scheme files which contain a collection of colours and base16 template files which contain syntax highlighting rules. A builder uses Git as the mechanism to download and keep up-to-date syntax files and template files.

## File Structure
- `/` - Contains anything you consider appropriate for your builder
- `/sources.yaml` - Holds a list of source repositories for schemes and templates
- `/sources/schemes/list.yaml` - Holds a list of scheme repositories
- `/sources/templates/list.yaml` - Holds a list of template repositories
- `/schemes/[name]/*.yaml` - A scheme file (there may be multiples of these)
- `/templates/[name]/templates/*.mustache` - A template file (there may be multiples of these)
- `/templates/[name]/templates/config.yaml` - A template configuration file

## Workflow
The first job a just-installed builder has is to populate a list of scheme sources and template sources. It does this by parsing the `/sources.yaml` file and using Git to clone the repositories defined within to `/sources`. Next, the builder will parse the downloaded `/sources/schemes/list.yaml` and use Git to clone the defined repositories to `/schemes`. Finally, the builder will parse the downloaded `/sources/templates/list.yaml` and use Git to clone the defined repositories to `/templates`. This task is performed by the `builder update` command, which can be used to update sources, schemes, and templates.

When building themes by running `builder` without any arguments, a base16 builder should first clear out any old output then iterate through all the scheme files in `/schemes` and for each scheme should iterate through all the template files in `/templates` producing themes that will be output to the template directories specified in `/templates/template_name/template/config.yaml`. The theme filename should look like `base16-[slug][extension]`. Where the slug is taken from the scheme filename made lowercase with spaces replaced with dashes and extension is taken from `/template/config.yaml`.

In the case where schemes share the same name, a builder will overwrite a perviously generated template file. Should this happen, a builder should show warning messages listing the overwritten template files.

## Template Variables
A builder should provide the following variables to a template file:

- `scheme-name` - obtained from the scheme file
- `scheme-author` - obtained from the scheme file
- `scheme-slug` - obtained from the scheme filename, as described above
- `base00-hex-r` to `base0F-hex-r` - built from the hex value in the scheme file e.g "7c"
- `base00-hex-g` to `base0F-hex-g` - built from the hex value in the scheme file e.g "af"
- `base00-hex-b` to `base0F-hex-b` - built from the hex value in the scheme file e.g "c2"
- `base00-rgb-r` to `base0F-rgb-r` - converted from the hex value in the scheme file e.g "124"
- `base00-rgb-g` to `base0F-rgb-g` - converted from the hex value in the scheme file e.g "175"
- `base00-rgb-b` to `base0F-rgb-b` - converted from the hex value in the scheme file e.g "194"
- `base00-dec-r` to `base0F-dec-r` - converted from the rgb value in the scheme file e.g "0.87..."
- `base00-dec-g` to `base0F-dec-g` - converted from the rgb value in the scheme file e.g "0.50..."
- `base00-dec-b` to `base0F-dec-b` - converted from the rgb value in the scheme file e.g "0.21..."

Builders should also provide the following variables for convenience:

- `base00-hex` to `base0F-hex` - obtained from the scheme file e.g "7cafc2"
- `base00-hex-bgr` to `base0F-hex-bgr` - built from a reversed version of all the hex values e.g "c2af7c"

## Code Structure
There is no outline for a recommended code structure that a base16 theme builder should follow but a design goal should be to keep the application as simple as possible providing only the functionality described in this document.

## Considerations
Mustache was chosen as the templating language due to its simplicity and widespread adoption across languages. YAML was chosen to describe scheme and configuration files for the same reasons.
