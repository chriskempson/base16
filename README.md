# ![Base16](logo.png)
Not a theme, but a framework for building [Tomorrow](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) styled themes using a base of sixteen colours. Since _August 2012_, Base16 has provided a minimal set of guidelines that explain how to [style syntax](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/main/styling.md) and [how to build](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/main/builder.md) Base16 [_schemes_ and _templates_](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/main/file.md).

## Limitations
Base16 was designed with the following limitations to ensure the project remains simple and keeps a small scope:
* A 16 colour palette of 8 shades and 8 accents
* All themes produced are the same apart from variations in colour
* You can't change the colour of one element without affecting another
* Builders are very simple and have one job
